Abstract

Most of the information we perceive is through our vision. Visual impairment can hamper
day to day task performing capability of an individual and among one of such crucial task is
learning. On this note. to provide an aid in independent learning for visually impaired per-
son, the system has been developed. The system captures image of textual documents using
# mobile application. As the image is captured by people who are visually challenged. the
image is likely to have distortions such as shadows and uneven illuminations. The captured
Image is sent to a remote server for pre-processing, involving binarization. noise reduction.
and layout analysis to make it suitable for OCR processing. The pre-processed image is fed
to an OCR engine to obtain textual format. The extracted text is then used to generate
speech as final output, enabling people to hear the text in the captured image.
